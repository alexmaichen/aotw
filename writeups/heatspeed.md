Zeus shield week means HeatSpeed cotw!
How fast can you go when everything is designed to end your run? Grab the aspect of your choice, turn up the heat to 32 or more, and figure out!

The 32 heat WRs by [magnil (6:15)](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/ylrv262y>) and [OckE (5:20)](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/mkoegxxz>) use everyone's favorite spaghetti plate named Beowulf <:Beowulf:1051763242512437289> to cause flood flare <:PoseidonBond:1051868916751814656> -> mirage shot <:PoseidonBond:1051868916751814656><:ArtemisBond:1051763235700871169> :green_square: destruction.
The 40 heat WRs by [magnil (6:53)](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/zp823r8y>) and [Jazz (6:13)](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/m70kjgwy>) again feature the same strategy.
50 heat is different though, as it is an [Ocaml (7:30)](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/mk5v5w3m>) World Record, unmodded no less! <:ZagShock:1051762480617111623> Here Rama <:Rama:1051868918765068319> was used, with an aphrodite <:AphroditeBond:1051763232513212536> attack start and hammers for additional scaling. In his modded run, [Timothy (8:35)](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/m3k36pgy>) instead runs this aspect with artemis :ArtemisBond: attack and dash. At this heat-level, the less needy a build is boon-wise, the better.

High heat builds can be quite diverse, so try to see what works for you! <:Dusa:1051762445200400414> 
For a basic high-heat overview for those uninitiated to high heat, [this guide by Bananas](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/16_JXPaAt8fegie6Ss2x5tVeaR-FzoFlIgp0etd3yLHI/edit?usp=sharing>) could help get you started on a 32 heat clear, which is frankly accessible to anyone with some practice.
