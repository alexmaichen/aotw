## Category of the Week : :ocean: Super Soaker :gun:
Ready your toy water-guns, this category requires them! Supersoaker is a meme category that forces you to run lucifer and equip a poseidon attack, and only taking attack-related hammers whenever possible.
This category is centered around the Sea Storm duoboon. The earlier you get that funny green boon offered, on average the better. Other useful boons include Static Discharge, Double Strike, Razor Shoals, Breaking Wave to name the main ones.
Here's the [unmodded WR by JDN](https://www.speedrun.com/hades_ce/runs/zgvlq3vz), and the [modded WR by oldmcjonald](https://www.speedrun.com/hades_ce/runs/y604k5jy) so you can check out how this might feel to play.
