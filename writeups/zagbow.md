# Aspect of the Week : :ZagWow: Zagreus Bow :bow:
Zagbow! You shoot, and 15% of the time you crit every time. Don't question my math, 15% of the time it's correct every time as well.
For this aspect, people start with the usual poseidon Tidal Dash and scale their build by getting a strong attack, attack-based hammers, and as much poseidon as they can get their hands on. An alternate build-path leans far more into the crits, and runs artemis attack + artemis dash + hunter's mark. For the finer details, [this build-path guide by Oshimia](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/guides/jbgyr>) has got you covered. In particular, I would recommend learning pseudotech, linked to by the guide.
The modded anyheat WR for zagbow by Ananke can be found [here](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/zq8vv31z>), and the unmodded record by Tounis [here](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/y66k3v6y>).


## For Heat
The build here is the same Flat Damage Soup idea as anyheat, except less (if any) emphasis is put on poseidon dash since it can become rather unreliable when enemies no longer die in one hit.
Timothy, in his [modded WR run at 60 heat](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiT-7iz5R08>) therefore opts to start out with Aphrodite attack instead. Meanwhile, [Stoner, in their unmodded record of 55](<https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Qs4y1Z7RQ/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0>), decide to start... POSEIDON ATTACK? Am I seeing this right?
Jokes aside, I assume they started poseidon as a consistency-option since 3/4 of his cores are fine to start with for the crowd-control they supply (attack/cast/dash), though dash likely stays the best option among the three.
