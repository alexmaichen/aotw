# Aspect of the Week : :magnet: Talos Fists :fist:
Despite being a staple among casual gamers, the Magnet Fists :tm: have less appeal in speedrunning.
You get a special that applies a debuff (+50% attack and cast damage) to an enemy, and pulls said enemy towards you.
However, the preferred builds still all involve :MercifulEnd: or ZAP.
The [unmodded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/yvvd8qoy>) and [modded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/z19g1ejm>) WR are held by ghosty and zyru respectively.
This [fist guide](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CPvQPqeeFE--dGgK62iVHx6Gwy7c8trb75RkEd9uK0I/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ddjj261pdpn9>) by Ananke and others should answer any questions one may have.


## for heat
Talos is a bit of a quirky fist heat-spect; it has three viable starting hammers: Long Knuckle, Breaching Cross and Heavy Knuckle.
As for boons, it wants the normal fist zeus attack, as well as various tier 2s...
... Unless someone wants to try heavy knuckle attack-scaling stuff (for example artemis or aphrodite to empower the attack) this week, since there's been discussion in the past about it?
Just like for anyheat, there are few (but also that much more dedicated) to this aspect.
The most active of these is Scratch, who has the WRs for both [unmodded (56)](<https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2134511569>) and [modded (58)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC51CzzlHyY&t=37s>).
