# Aspect of the Week : :zap: Eris Rail :gun:
Eris is one of the most facetanky aspects in Hades the game, and is therefore a common speedrun-beginner pick. Keep standing in your special for that innate rare Rush Delivery (kinda)!

Eris pretty much feels *designed* to run Flat Damage Soup!
More specifically, the preferred things to get are
Zeus: attack, Static Discharge + poms, Lightning Rod and Splitting Bolt
Artemis: special, Lightning Rod, and maybe some tier 2s
Poseidon: Dash + poms, Razor Shoals, Breaking Wave. Sea Storm is an option too but takes a while to build towards, making it unreliable.

Rush Delivery and dashes are both viable options.

Hammer-wise, one is looking for Rocket Bomb > Cluster Bomb > Triple Bomb > Delta Chamber > Targeting System > Flurry Fire (?) > everything else

[Wmic's unmodded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/yvo94xxz>) and [Webs' modded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/y60xoj6y>) both use Eris to its fullest effect using the aforementioned ZAP build.

Check out [Wmic's Eris guide](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/13lSPIUsiJGr5vApeon6ayX9N4-UlvGHWrCGdYAxhvHM/edit?tab=t.0>) for the in-depth mechanics and build-options.


## for heat
Delta Chamber is the preferred hammer here due to giving iframes to the rail's dashstrike. Yup, that's it, that's the only major difference.
Check out [PlayAd's unmodded WR (61)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npg3u3wLEBg>) as well as [PlayAd's modded WR (64)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWLJvB4-CX4>) to see peak gameplay.
