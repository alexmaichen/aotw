## Category of the Week : :four: ROWO :gun:
It's time for the most historically accurate weapon in Hades the videogame, the gun. All four versions of it, all in a row.
Hestia starts Poseidon dash and builds off of its high base damage, while the other four rails start zeus attack or Poseidon dash, and get as many individual flat damage sources as possible. Shoutouts to zagrail for spicing things up and providing the option of Merciful End, in the event you wish to play the fifth fist aspect of hades the videogame!

Both rowo records are held by Wmic, with the [unmodded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/yvv508oy>) and [modded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/z58jppdz>) WRs being available to watch.

ROWO asks the runner to complete consecutive runs with each rail aspect (in any order). Of the 4 aspects, we just discussed Zag Rail. Lucifer can follow the "budget eris" template outlined for Zag rail, although it wants triple bomb as first hammer. Eris can also be built like budget Eris, but will perform more like Eris without quite so much budget. Hesty is the odd one out, starting splash dash and looking for high% attack boons (or shackle) and anything else to buff its empowered shot.

As usual, here are the [unmodded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/yvv508oy>) and [modded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/z58jppdz>) rowo records by wmic.
