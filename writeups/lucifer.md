# Aspect of the Week : :smiling_imp: Lucifer Rail :gun:
All of the weapons' hidden version is always the clunkiest of the four, and luci is no different.
It comes with an attack that takes ages to come out, ramps inconsequential amounts of damage.
While that part doesn't sound appealing, its special may be a bit more interesting: Instead of exploding instantly, the ball of... plasma?... sticks around until it either takes a hit or more than 3 specials have been deployed.
Combine this special-gimmick with the Triple Bomb hammer, and this aspect goes from looking like a complete joke to an A-tier laser-pointer of death.
The WRs for [unmodded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/yl79wdxm>) and [modded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/m3x2o84m>) are both held by wmic.
No guides exist for this aspect, so here's the cliffnotes version: Look for the usual Zeus Artemis Poseidon (ZAP) stuff [like you would on Eris](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/13lSPIUsiJGr5vApeon6ayX9N4-UlvGHWrCGdYAxhvHM/edit?tab=t.0>), as well as the Triple Bomb hammer. Aiming the special with a mouse ("mousetech") is recommended.

## for heat
There are two competing meta strategies: Zeus attack VS Triple Bomb + strong special.
The former handles Damage Control just fine, but struggles with lack of mobility.
The latter has mobility, but struggles against Damage Control and savior-enemies. Aphrodite is quite common, but anything that's not dionysus, ares or poseidon can probably work fine too.
To alleviate this Damage Control problem by making the bombs trigger automatically and hitting the enemy before the bombs go off, the [unmodded WR (55) by 索方索](<https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1E5411R7yP/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0>) uses a zeus special.
The [modded WR (60) by Cheesy](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xekEnq8mEYg>) meanwhile uses an artemis special.
