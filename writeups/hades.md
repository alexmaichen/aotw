# Aspect of the Week : <:DisappointmentChampion:1051762443476549642> Hades Spear :fork_and_knife:
It's Alena week! This fork adds 150% attack- and special-damage to enemies hit by the "Punishing Sweep" AKA spiiiiiiin.
Go for the usual Merciful End (the build both the [unmodded WR by arcalena](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/z0xw6pjz>) as well as the [modded WR by bablo](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/zgq199jy>) go for), or try running Flat Damage Soup for consistency, as is common in multirun categories for example. Your choice. More build ideas can be found in [this guide by trash_lapras](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W2XyhC7JB1eZNtvHk0NrHl0F2vbN7om9BdNknkUUX34/edit).
In terms of hammers, Exploding Launcher is the preferred choice, as it allows for good second hammer scaling using charged skewer. Quick spin and massive spin can work too, though keep in mind spins don't get buffed by themselves.


## for heat
More emphasis is put on the spin, with flat damage soup being the norm.
Tailesque, in his [unmodded WR at 55 heat](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh3nKCFiweA>), started zeus, then coped through a zeus dash start due to AP2 (was likely going for zeus attack), to finally get the elauncher -> cskewer hammer combo described above.
Cheesy gets serrated point in his [modded WR of 60](<https://youtube.com/watch?v=qMAsG_HFEjM>), and scales it even further by starting with artemis attack. "Where there's a serrated, there's a way!"
As usual, Merciful End is too unreliable to go for at this heat-level.
