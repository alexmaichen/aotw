# Aspect of the Week : :snowflake: Demeter / Zagfists :drop_of_blood:
Fist! Gang! Fist! Gang! Fist! Gang! It's your week!

The Aspect of Demeter is a fan-favourite when it comes to pipelines to hades speedrunning, and for good reason: its moveset is simple to understand, intuitive and feels smooth to play, while also having a high skill ceiling for those wishing to optimize their play. Go and hit those Charged Cutters!
Zagfists is played nearly the same, except it does not have the instakill option for some enemies that the charged cutter ability provides on Demeter.

You have two main options available: Merciful End (the duoboon between Ares' attack and Athena's special, also looking for Impending Doom and Divine Dash) or ZAP (*Z*eus attack, *A*rtemis special, *P*oseidon dash, and additionally looking for various tier 2 boons from these three gods). As for hammers, both of these fists want Breaching Cross the most, but Demeter especially can (for the unmodded players out there) also accept Kinetic Launcher for a faster animation or Explosive Upper for straight up more damage. Long Knuckle is a weird one for speed but can prove to be useful too.

For those interested, a [fist guide](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CPvQPqeeFE--dGgK62iVHx6Gwy7c8trb75RkEd9uK0I/edit?tab=t.0>) - written by Ananke and others - is available

The zagfists ([unmodded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/y2klg59y>) / [modded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/m3v9rxgz>)) and Demeter ([unmodded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/zpppgggz>) / [modded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/z0n53e8m>)) records are all held by Ananke.


## for heat
Forget about Merciful End, it's too unreliable. ZAP still works wonders, except people tend to leave out two of these gods, basing their damage fully on one of them, with often a few Athena boons for safety and convenience. Dionysus attack has also seen some use. In terms of hammers, Breaching Cross is still a meta-option but all of the hammers mentioned in the any heat part of the writeup can be reasonable choices (Long Knuckle especially).

Retrash's [unmodded Dem WR (55)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG8Rp0EW3Zo>) runs a full Artemis setup, basing the damage on the cutter ability. Meanwhile, the [unmodded zagfists WR (55)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrGTflRwNJI>) by Hadesprofessor... is unavailable? privated? Oh dear. The highest-heat legal recording of a zagfists run is a [52 heat run](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFh0TTCw_IE>) by Retrash, in which he runs dio attack.
For modded, the [Dem WR (60)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42BT490mSfQ>) by Cheesy and the [zagfists WR (57)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjbcSoIpezU>) by Angel are both available, and run Zeus attack.
