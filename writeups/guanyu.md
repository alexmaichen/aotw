# Aspect of the Week : :RunInsurance: Guan Yu Spear :no_entry_sign:
Health is a lie made up by Big Centaurheart designed to make you keep buying more hearts! This aspect is all glass, and not so much cannon (though not the weakest aspect out there either <:Dusa:1051762445200400414> ).

Once - a long time ago - considered a top :MercifulEnd: aspect, anyheat Guan Yu can essentially be built in one of two basic ways. You'll either be running Flat Damage Soup or Merciful End, both of which have already been covered thoroughly in previous writeups.

Look for Hermes Rush Delivery as usual. Bonus dashes can work too. Honorable mentions go out to the special- and attack-speed boons as well as dodge chance, but these are the back-up-iest of back-ups.

Since Flurry Jab is unavailable, hammer-wise you'll most likely be looking for Charged Skewer first, and preferably Breaching Skewer second. Back-up options (especially on ME) include Quick Spin and Massive Spin.

[Cgull's unmodded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/zxndkqem>) runs a hybrid of the two strategies, opting to run ME despite poseidon dash. [Bablo's modded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/zxlxd95z>) instead leans fully into Merciful End.

This [spear guide by trash_lapras](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W2XyhC7JB1eZNtvHk0NrHl0F2vbN7om9BdNknkUUX34/edit>) should have some useful information about spears in general.


## for heat
HERE is where GY really gets to shine! Guan Yu spear is one of the aspects to have a 64 heat clear.

Taking a look at the [modded heat WR by PlayAd (64 without the Mac-specific Guan Yu bug)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvH93Mfp450>), the run used the Quick Spin and Massive Spin hammers + an athena attack to deal with Damage Control while having basically shield-amounts of safety. The [unmodded WR (61, again by PlayAd)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navDwcuXfys>) used this same idea.

One may also start Charged Skewer and have special deal most of the damage, but this is more enemy-dependent and can be riskier to play. Definitely a valid option though.

ME is off the table as usual.
