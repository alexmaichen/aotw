# Aspect of the Week : :croven: Hera Bow :diamonds:
The croven-bow ™️ lets you, not unlike everyone's favourite spaghetti plate, load casts into your next attack.
Your goal is to load only as many Aphrodite-casts as you will need to 1-shot the enemy you are aiming to kill, and load casts with Demeter's Snow Burst in the right places to dispose of smaller enemies.
This is a mechanically complex aspect, but becomes one of the fastest in the game once mastered. Hera used to have the overall anyheat World Record after all!

Hammer-wise you want one of flurry shot, triple shot or twin shot to start. Point-blank shot, perfect shot and explosive shot are decent second hammers to get.
In terms of Hermes boons one will always prefer looking for Hyper Sprint -> Rush Delivery as usual, though Quick Reload can be taken as well as it can be less punishing to play, especially if you have poor cast-management.
If you want to see some top-level Hera gameplay, the [unmodded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/zn7oq57m>) and [modded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/y96232ry>) WRs by Croven are good places to check out. <:croven:1051762439840080033>
Here's a self-proclaimed "scuffed" [hera guide](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IHgXN-_iYn3G2BWUJ05GSi0Qm4j4FsE0yPNM3stKpOE/edit?tab=t.0>) by croven and cgull to dive into the aspect's mechanics.


## for heat
There are to my knowledge three or four viable build-paths for high-heat Hera.
Aphrodite's cast + Demeter's Snow Burst is still one of them as proven by the [unmodded WR (56)](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/yjp2wqdy>) by Nitrostarch, but is thought by some to be too unreliable since some enemies in high heat hard-counter cast-based builds.
In her [modded WR (57)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QkVDRppoJw&feature=youtu.be>), AngeL1C instead scales damage off of an Aphrodite attack and attack-hammers.
Athena cast (for death defiance refills) or Poseidon cast (for crowd-control early on against nasty Tartarus enemies and decent styx cleanup) instead could provide some utility, at the cost of ease-of-play in large rooms and boss-damage.
A lot of things are about equal in clearability on this aspect, so feel free to try whichever one of these options suits you best.
