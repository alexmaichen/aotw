# Aspect of the Week 252: :speedeline: Achilles Spear :fork_and_knife:
Solid A-tier aspect, however hammer-hungry. It's also mechanically one of the hardest to master.

Achilles is a FlurryJab-spect. I know vibes are usually subjective, but in this case, without flurry Achilles is significantly weaker and objectively feels bad to play. Start Poseidon dash. One will try to acquire an Artemis or Zeus attack, and a cast that opens the corresponding duo with said attack (Hunting Blades / Lightning Phalanx / Lightning Rod if you want to commit that crime). You can accept any of the usual hermes options (Greatest Reflex, or Hyper Sprint and Rush Delivery).

Since there are multiple build-paths available (each with their own unique decisionmaking), 185's [Achilles Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eAOEli9KqJOVyPD7U-6D1o1yZx1tDMQWLDcMJr8G84E) might help.

Here's the [unmodded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/mke5n15m>) by 185 and the [modded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/yo60w31y>), also by 185.


## for heat
You can run essentially anything as long as you're good enough at the aspect, due to Achilles' massive additive scaling on nearly everything. Still want flurry jab though.
llzzqq's [unmodded WR (57)](<https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1wd4y1K7Sh/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0>) and [modded WR (60)](<https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1214y1c767/#reply779270232>) should help you get an idea.
