# Aspect of the Week : :camel: Rama Bow :bow:
zzzzzoop. zzzzzoop. eouuuuuuuuuuuung. *enemy-obliteration noises*
Rama is probably the most punishing speedrunning aspect in the whole game. Despite this, it holds the WR for 50 heat and once briefly held the anyheat WR!

You'll be looking to scale your damage off of hammers and a %-based attack. For further inspiration, check out the [unmodded WR by Ocaml](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/yvq9084m>) and the [modded WR by Timothy](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJa1hYpO0Y4>). Several handy pieces of advice are also presented in [Scalarmotion's Rama Guide](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/12I4fjG04we8_CoH9eeEXKQGcDJ37D6HW0PTNmWru0zA/view?tab=t.0#heading=h.yeqba8orna5g>), it's a must-read!


## For Heat
The main heat strategy on Rama is to get a mighty attack (usually Aphrodite attack or Artemis attack/dash), twin or triple shot hammer, and from there be a god at the aspect.
While [PlayAd's unmodded WR (64)](<https://youtu.be/Osnijisn1bI?feature=shared>) used Artemis dash and attack, [his modded WR (64)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQAWPUaUxTw>) forced Aphrodite to start since FirstBoonEpic is allowed.
