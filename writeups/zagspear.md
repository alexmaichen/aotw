# Aspect of the Week : :zagPls~1: Zagreus Spear :fork_and_knife:

The Aspect of Zagreus on the spear is about as basic as it gets: It buffs your special's damage and range, yet said special ends up not being built around most of the time. Either way, what build you go for is completely your call since build-choices can be decently open-ended outside of hammers.

The most important parts of your build are usually going to be 1: your first hammer, 2: Poseidon dash, 3: your Poseidon dash, and 4: your attack. You're also looking for Hermes Hyper Sprint -> Rush Delivery, or Greatest Reflex.

As with any melee aspect, :MercifulEnd: is one of the meta strategies. I don't need to explain this one, do I?

There is another build-path involving Exploding Launcher + Charged Skewer which can be a valid backup option if you are playing unmodded. 

Another option would be to base your damage off of Smoldering Air and having a powerful call to carry the run.

As usual, here are the [unmodded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/zxg7d18y>) by magnil, and the [modded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/z52720dz>) by bablo. :cactus:


## for heat
There are three main changes, which are the usual 1: "divine dash is good but building towards ME is not", the usual 2: "extra dashes are even better than usual", and the slightly less usual "serrated point is likely a viable backup option". Do with that information what you will. :relieved:

For inspiration, here are the [unmodded WR (55)](<https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1gs4y1h7EL/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=f11ff48f182a1b78e6f17407eedd459f>) and the [modded WR (60)](<https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nD421M7uA/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=f11ff48f182a1b78e6f17407eedd459f>), both by llzzqq.
