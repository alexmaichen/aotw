# Aspect of the Week : :zap: Zeus Shield :fork_knife_plate:
The aspect of Zeus allows Zagreus to throw out his spinny serving platter of death... while keeping it in his hands!? How does that even work? Anyhow, it's one of two aspects with unmodded unseeded 64 heat clears.

For anyheat Zeus, Merciful End :MercifulEnd: is the meta. There's nuance, however: This aspect likes ares on attack :MercifulEnd: as much as on special :MercifulEnd: (just pick whatever has higher rarity)! If you don't feel like running ME, the "Zeus Squared" build-path (explained below) is an option as well.
In terms of hammers, Explosive Return and Charged Shot are both appreciated.

For Zeus shield, the [unmodded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/yd99n1wz>) by heidibleat and [modded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/z16r8xjm>) by ananke both use ME.


## for heat
There are also two main build-paths:
- Zeus squared (zeus special, then as many zeus tier 2s as possible and maybe even splitting bolt :ZeusBond: :orange_square: !)
- Aphrodite special with rarity and a few extra poms.
In both cases, Explosive Return is a must, while Charged Shot is usually viewed as detrimental since it removes a fair bit of much-needed safety.

[This video](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdY7-xPn444>) by duunk0 goes over some basics of this mechanically complex aspect. For a deeper dive into the specifics of the damage rotation, Mysterra did [some Zeus experimentation](<https://youtu.be/jCd8FuYezpE>).

In terms of heat, there are several 64 heat clears with mods, but for brevity's sake, here are the only two unmodded ones by [Angel1c](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mo-kXjasZs>) and [摆子哥](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbT1vB74Aa0>)
