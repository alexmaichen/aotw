# Aspect of the Week : :angry: Nemesis Sword :crossed_swords:
If you like swords and you like having damage, you're in luck! This aspect is quite good at both of those things.
Speaking of luck, Nemesis the sword comes equipped with a 30% crit-chance.
Artemis- and crit-related builds feels like the natural synergy to this, though the classic Merciful End idea also exists like on any other melee aspect. In the event you go the crit-related route, Poseidon's dash and Hunter's Mark would the main money-makers. Acquiring the Heart Rend duoboon also boosts your damage a significant degree, but isn't required. acquiring a Zeus-core or call would also let you open some handy duos.

The FDS crit-build is more reliant on the Double Edge hammer than the ME path is, but that latter build comes with its own set of inconsistencies.

Cgull's [unmodded WR](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCDC5X_mkbc>) displays ME's power. Croven's [modded WR](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwpn_6J6rfA>) however showcases a ZAP build. :croven:

In the event you need help playing nem, here's a [guide by trash_lapras](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GvdbSS3DrM0LHzZWWmWHt15Z87LFNUf-xUmH1_BMLps/edit?usp=sharing>) to help.


## for heat
The [unmodded WR (57)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mQwfdTfozM&feature=youtu.be>) by Retrash uses a crit-based Demeter attack strategy. Ares' dash also contributed a fair amount of damage. This being a Retrash sword run, the purse was picked as a starting-keepsake.
Angel's [modded WR (60)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMxdClus0s>) instead utilized an Athena attack start, with some damage and enemy-grouping coming from Poseidon's dash.

As you might pick up from this information, Merciful End is as usual a bit unreliable, but can work well until about 45.
