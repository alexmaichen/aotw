# Aspect of the Week : <:ZagGrin:1051762473419673661> Zagreus Shield 🛡️

Imagine a world where your base shield deals slightly more attack damage to make cleaning up early enemies easier. If that sounds like fun, this may be the aspect for you!

Zagshield is a very basic shield aspect, and by basic shield aspect I mean "get Charged Shot, poseidon dash a beefy attack early, or lose". Merciful End can work as well, but is likely not worth the gamble (and is somewhat clunky to work the combo for).
Thus, both the [unmodded WR by OckE](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/m3kk2ggy>) as well as the [modded WR by Ananke](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7D5rvlL6jc>) scale using the former Flat Damage Soup strategy.

There are no guides to be found to my knowledge, but the build should be simple enough for this not to matter. Just keep buffing your dash and attack and you'll be fine. <:wmicletsgo:927706913909637140>


## For Heat
The build doesn't change except one should probably think twice before starting with poseidon dash. Aphrodite attack tends to be the norm due to its sheer power, but I can also see athena start working since it would make for 2/4 good options in the first boon (attack or dash, potentially useful for unmodded), as well as letting the player open death defiance refills right away. One could also consider getting Divine Protection or Deadly Reversal later, though that'd be a significant gamble. Artemis attack does not sound too bad either as an unmodded backup option due to first boon not being guaranteed to be attack.

Instead, Divine Dash tends to be significantly more useful, as seen all three of Angel's [modded TWR at 62 heat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtDp6fCcyS8), [五维过客's TWR](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pe41127Me) and [Cheesy's TWR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMgB_1blciY). <a:idkman:861427521165852673>
Angel instead started with the shattered shackle for her [60 heat unmodded WR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6GipboAH3I), and took the first useful attack she could find (in this case an artemis attack + two chaos attack-buffs later).
