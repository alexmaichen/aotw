## Category of the Week : :no_entry_sign: Hitless/Damageless :punch:
With an aspect where one doesn't have much health comes a category where the objective is to lose none (along with several other sources of run-invalidation)!
Hitless and Damageless are similar to one another. Avoid anything that can harm or interact with you in any way. Lightning Rod and Static Discharge can be recommended pickups, but by far not necessary if the aspect is strong enough. The appeal of Lightning Rod may make God's Legacy tempting, but you'd lose out of some much-appreciated rarity; all in all it's a choice you have to decide for yourself. Infernal Soul can be solid if you are also running God's Legacy to open Lightning Rod (or if the aspect you are playing is a castspect), but not otherwise. Getting extra dashes from Hermes is considered to be even better than usual, but still does not beat out a Hyper Sprint + Rush Delivery of any rarity.

Pick up the aspect of your choice (usually Hestia, Eris, Rama or a non-Gilgamesh fist) and start a run! While there are resources out there to help, the most important part is to know all enemy patterns and take one's time whenever necessary. This [hitless guide](<https://youtu.be/DriOl6mqqpU&t=3091>) by kappavt goes over nearly every enemy and how to deal with it.

There are way too many different subcategories to all list here, but the more competitive times are [unmodded Hitless + Damageless](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades_ce/runs/ylje6knm>) by alexca (me! :D) and [modded hitless](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades_ce/runs/m3x3g46m>) by zyru.

Mental health PSA: Do not play too much at a time of this category. You WILL get burnt out, especially if running FO2.
