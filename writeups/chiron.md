# Aspect of the Week : :horse: Chiron Bow :man:

Being many a casual player's favorite aspect, Chiron comes equipped with a simple yet oddly satisfying moveset: An attack that sets a target for the special, and a special to home onto the target. Unfortunately the ol' centaur lost a bit of damage before being revealed by Zagreus.

Thanks to its homing special, this aspect can roll nearly anything, as long as it's supported by rush delivery and powerful hammers. Get a poseidon dash and its tier 2s for tartarus and styx, and focus on scaling off of attacks or specials or ROD :ZeusBond: :ArtemisBond: ! If you decide to try attack builds, I would recommend learning [pseudo-bowtech](<https://discord.com/channels/940392249844465694/1226901464417570866/1226901464417570866>) and reading through this [zagbow guide by Oshimia](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/guides/jbgyr>) which covers that same build.

If that explanation was too verbose, check out the AnyHeat WRs for [unmodded (by Magnil)](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/y66gwpjy>) and [modded (by Mystic)](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/yllo7o2y>) respectively for inspiration. Again, a lot of builds can work so feel free to roll with whatever works for you.


## for heat
Special-strats are favored here due to staying at range usually being recommended at high heat. I'm sorry, but there's not much more I can say, you'll have to see for yourself. Try zeus attack pseudotech if you want, which doesn't sound like it should work but according to experimentation by some (Mysterra mainly) it works wonders.

Here's the [unmodded WR (58) by Stoner](<https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ej411g7cm/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=897c012bf99634926eb8f6fec30d9a20>) that uses zeuscall smoldering air as its main form of damage, and the [modded WR (60) by Timothy](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCbMbg75to>) using aphrodite special.
