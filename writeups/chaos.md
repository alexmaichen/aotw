# Aspect of the Week : :ChaosBond: Chaos Shield 🛡️
Remember last zagshield week? Yeah, this aspect works in pretty much the same way, but less strong. The shield of chaos has a special-related gimmick that at least in theory sounds powerful, however in practice this barely sees any use, much to the dismay of the one likely posting this writeup.
The general strategy - in the event last line wasn't clear enough - is to start Poseidon dash, acquire the Charged Shot hammer as soon as remotely possible, acquire a strong attack and get Rush Delivery, and additionally look for chaos attack buffs. Optional but recommended things to acquire include Lightning Rod and the modpack due to the aspect's even greater reliance on cshot than zagshield.
Thus, both the records for [unmodded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/me7d729y>) by tounis and [modded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/zpwxe3ny>) by guan yeezy do exactly this.


## for heat
just get cshot and a strong attack (preferably aphrodite or athena), blah blah blah, same buildpath as zagshield here too. shoutouts to Divine Dash for added safety.
