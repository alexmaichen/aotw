# Aspect of the Week : :ocean: Poseidon Sword :crossed_swords:

The aspect of poseidon! This aspect is fairly basic in the sense that it doesn't really change the attack-rotation, but at least the innate +50% cast damage bonus might help with build-variety, slightly spicing up the experience <:Dusa:1051762445200400414>

There are multiple ways of starting a Poseidon sword run. Some might start ares and build towards Merciful End as seen in Tounis' [unmodded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/z5rq33dy>), others might start Tidal Dash to make their way towards a more Flat Damage Soup build. Others again might focus on casts and either start poseidon and take that instead of dash if the dash isn't good enough (with plans of potentially pivoting towards Merciful End later if the opportunity presents itself, else continuing with FDS ideas), start athena cast and build towards Lightning Phalanx, or mostly ignore the aspect's buff and start zeus cast to build towards Lightning Rod instead like Bablo in his [modded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/mkq3ex1m>).

The "Double Edge" hammer is a must as usual. From Hermes, you'll want dashes or Hyper Sprint -> Rush Delivery like on nearly any other aspect. Flurry Cast or Quick Reload are funny but likely aren't as handy as just 1-shotting enemies instead.

For those who don't understand any of what I've just talked about, trash_lapras' [sword guide](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GvdbSS3DrM0LHzZWWmWHt15Z87LFNUf-xUmH1_BMLps/edit?tab=t.0>) goes into detail about it and should tell you all you need to know.


## for heat
Other than that, you are likely to want to run some attack-related stategies. Casts are too unreliable for damage, so you are best off playing it using the attack, with dionysus (such as in Angel's [modded WR (56)](<https://youtu.be/cbAmDPfUI6M>)) or zeus on the attack... Or be Retrash and in classic Retrash fashion equip the coin-purse as your first keepsake as seen in [the unmodded WR (55)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftOMJ5scu3c>)??? 
As usual, ME is too needy to be considered for anything much past 40 or 45.

Double Edge is still a top hammer to acquire, but World Splitter start (+ athena attack) can work too!
