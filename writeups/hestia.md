# Aspect of the Week : :fire: Hestia Rail :gun:
Hestia Bestia!
Just reload -> dash -> dash -> special -> attack -> reload -> dash -> dash -> attack.
Got it? Now do it many more times.

This aspect has an absurdly low build-requirement, clocking in at an incredible third place on the unmodded boards ([run by Zyruvias](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/y2grkqwz>)), or this [modded 24th place run, also by zyruvias](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/z1n6ekry>).
Get your poseidon dash, get an chunky attack and special (or shattered shackle) and go to town! Cluster Rockets and Rush Delivery will help.
Pay no regard to what attack-boon the modded record uses, pls and ty; it was a justified situational pick and should not be seen as the norm.

Hammer-wise, one is looking for the famed Rocket Bomb + Cluster Bomb hammer combination, but some more niche hammers can bring decent results as well; most notably Ricochet Fire, Hazard Bomb, or Rocket Bomb + Triple Bomb.

This [written guide by Zyruvias](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1019DSLlyHwg7_oIiN3Il-NUYdHEbl783G7ZvstFSCD4/edit?usp=sharing>) and this [video guide by Duunk0](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie5e_6fIFms>) should contain all there is to know about this aspect.


## for heat
One still wants the same strong attack, strong special... but when it comes to hammers, even more variety is allowed.

Piercing Fire and Ricochet Fire get additional value. An important thing to note is that getting Cluster Bomb or Triple Bomb first can be appreciated, as it gives Hestia a solid way of disposing of saviour-enemies. Rocket Bomb meanwhile loses its purpose as a first hammer, being preferred as second hammer (especially if one can acquire Clockets / Trockets through it). Targeting System is a weird hammer but can work wonders when one gets an Artemis attack/special.

As expected, on Hestia, enabling Damage Control to any extent is a no-go (unless you want to commit the crime of playing it as discount Eris rail).
AP2 becomes a perfectly sane option along the lines of 50 heat, as Hestia can run almost anything.
At the high-end, Routine Inspection 3+ is forced, but even at around 50 I consider it a viable alternative as long as the player is used to fighting heroes and dad with 1 dash. If you do run RI3, Greatest Reflex, Hyper Sprint or even Greater Haste should be rolled for. Rush Delivery is good too, but too rare to aim for as usual on AP2. Even in the event one gets no useful Hermes boons, the run can be playable, however try to get a call (any call) to be able to iframe otherwise unavoidable instances of damage in Ely, heroes and dad. If you can't even get THAT, try to get Divine Dash, it makes iframing some EM4 attacks more lenient, in some cases helps deal with bad EM4 summons, and can lead to Blinding Flash for bonus damage.

The unmodded heat sheet lists [AlexCA's (me!) 59 Heat](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOTnZ5RawIg>) as the record; a run with shackle-start, mediocre hammers, but a lot of survivability.
For modded, here's [Zyruvias' 60 Heat](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4fOOByXBtI>) World Record; using the Hazard Bomb hammer and the Aphrodite keepsake to start.
In both cases, extra dashes were acquired.
