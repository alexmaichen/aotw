## Category of the Week : :three: Weapons :question: :question: :question:
Tired of playing only one weapon, but you don't want to go through the hassle of resetting for Merciful End or learning too many other playstyles? Now you can!
3Weps lets you choose the weapons you want and do a run with each, in a row! Time starts at the start of the first run and ends upon the third dad-kill.

Here's the unmodded WR by [trash_lapras](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/zq9p759y>) and the modded WR by [185](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/zq7v885m>).
