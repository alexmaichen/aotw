## Category of the Week : :seedling: Seeded Loyalty Card :credit_card:
Do **you** wish you could just get the things ™️ every attempt? Are **you** tired of slow unmodded resets? Are **you** tired of spending 15 or so minutes per speedrun attempt? Seeded Loyalty Card has got your back: Just do the manips and movement right and you'll soon find yourself getting optimal RNG.

Let's try something new for AotW! Earlier this year, a Loyalty Card route that abuses the scripted poseidoncall run was discovered! While the "seeded" option did not win in the AotW200 polls, some major interest for low-rng categories was expressed.

Go watch [Vorime's WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades_ce/runs/mewrgx8m>) to get an idea of the sheer SPEED.
