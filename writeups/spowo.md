## Category of the Week : :ZagreusSpear: :Achilles: SpOWO :Hades: :GuanYu:
I present to you: four aspects that can be played with nearly identical build-path (:MercifulEnd:), but can also be played a bit differently from each other. This being an RTA category, on-the-fly decisionmaking is favored, so it is likely you'll be running at least one of these branching paths depending on aspect:
- Guan Yu wants Charged Skewer almost immediately only when running fds. On ME, it's less clear-cut if you just get the build fast.
- Hades spear can of course run ME or splash, but if one is to not use ME then having artemis' attack is quite important; how else would one utilize the 150% bonus damage to attacks?
- Zag Spear is the most boring of the four aspects, with the extra special damage rarely coming into play. Just splash or ME.
- Achilles runs rarely ever use ME due to the aspect being quite strong indeed. This aspect doesn't just have unparalleled movement, but it also can get a lot of damage out of a chunky cast in the event the rest of the build doesn't want to cooperate.
