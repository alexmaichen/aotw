# Aspect of the Week : :ZagEyes: Zag Rail 🔫
Do you like Eris the rail? Yes? Well this is that, but also kinda different, I guess...?

Zagreus rail is, like all other zagspects, quite basic. The rail gets more bullets, which theoretically should mean more damage, right?
The famous "Budget Eris" build path is exactly what you'd expect, minus Eris' damage. This means start poseidon dash or zeus attack, acquire a strong special, look for as many zeus and poseidon boons as you can.
If you don't feel like playing bad Eris, Zagrail has its own two exclusive build paths as well! The Spread Fire hammer allows the player to play the aspect more like a fist, enemy hitstun included... And consequently, like on the fists, Merciful End and FDS both work well on this.
A third - more unique - build-path exists as well for the modded folks: start shackle, acquire spread fire, hope you encounter artemis attack, and stack as many attack-, dashstrike- and backstab-chaos as possible (yes this strategy uses shadow presence). In the event you don't get artemis attack, simply keep on the shattered shackle! It will provide all of the damage you may need pre-Elysium, and aid with breakpoints one would commonly rely on fiery presence for. This is allegedly "the future of zag rail"! :eyes:

If you are curious as to what a rapid zagrail run may look like, the [unmodded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/zp1v30vz>) by magnil and the [modded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/yw38d60m>) by wmic both can help.

This [eris guide](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/13lSPIUsiJGr5vApeon6ayX9N4-UlvGHWrCGdYAxhvHM>) should tell you much of what you need to start running the non-Hestia rails.


## for heat
Use the budget eris build path explained above. Don't need to explain this point much further, I think. You need the range of base rail and the consistency of the ZAP build. Acquiring Delta Chamber will give you more iframes, so probably go and look for that. If you instead want to go insane looking for clockets then you could try that too, however I'd advise against it. There are many more valuable ways to spend one's time.
