How fast can you go without all of the usual permanent upgrades? It's time to find out. Get :MercifulEnd: (and Divine Protection :orange_square: for those less familiar with monodash sword combat) and try to remember you have one single dash!
[Nitrostarch's WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/z1l36o9m>) is likely the best showing of what a near-perfect run through first run looks like.

If you haven't played FF before (or at least in a while) and wish to get into it, this [first-run guide](<https://scientific-paprika-b40.notion.site/Hades-Fresh-File-First-Run-Guide-2d647029f5c34252acbd38ad5e54b221>) by Sophie has all there is to know, and links to further relevant resources.


## Category of the Week : :ice_cube: Fresh File :file_folder:
The premise of this cotw is simple: start a new savefile and Slay the S- uh, Father, as quickly as possible, regardless of if that is done first-run or not.
Several routes exist, but the fastest ones are [this](<https://scientific-paprika-b40.notion.site/Hades-Fresh-File-First-Run-Info-2d647029f5c34252acbd38ad5e54b221>) for sword, and [this](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/guides/ha5fo>) for bow (except the current meta strategy for bow is to die in athenaroom on run 1, to have a second hammer three runs later, as well as the guaranteed c1 hammer).
There are to my knowledge no official written guides for the other weapons, so here's my abridged version of one:

shield:
get 3 keys ASAP, and hope for charged shot on run 3. get a chunky attack for further scaling. backup strats such as explosive return or Merciful End exist, but probably don't scale well enough or are too unreliable.

spear:
die in athenaroom once (or don't, this weapon is rather unplayed and there's much to opimize here), then get 4 keys and escape on the run with guaranteed hammer (run 4 if you died in athenaroom, else run 3). Get one (or 2) good hammers to scale.

fists:
beat meg, collect her titan blood, die until lounge opens (run 5 iirc), get the 1/6 diceroll for the wretched broker 1 blood -> 200 gems trade, buy all weapons, die one more time, buy fists, build ZAP or ME.

rail:
like fists but you need to get 4 keys manually, you need to die one extra time after unlocking fists, and hammers are even more important than on fists.

Oh, we'll also be tracking your fastest Fresh File To Credits (FFTC) runs this week. A guide for that can be found [here](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IDDsaoZ_DSCk2TMg8UjDB4RLXc7IKvL9t-2GM9q2nx0/edit?tab=t.0>) and a one for the "No Unlocks" subcategory [here](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eqRSjZ1Rx6WNH2EXrpuxgRQs_KhMhDg0GCr_naTBIfQ/edit?tab=t.0>).
