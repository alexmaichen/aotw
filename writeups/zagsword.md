# Aspect of the Week : :ZagPls: Zagreus Sword :person_fencing: 
The Blade of Zagreus, AKA aspect of Rush Delivery... more than other aspects, anyway. Its innate movement speed boost just pairs incredibly with *that* Hermes-boon!
You'll be looking to build either the powerful :MercifulEnd: like [Tounis'](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/ylr3d62y>) in his unmodded WR, or try the arguably more reliable (but trickier to build) Flat Damage Soup strategies like in [Zyru's](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDSZZJMtXTw>) modded WR, you choose!
Also consider equipping the plume at some point in the run for that sweet movement speed and more chances at Rush Delivery! :Dusa: 
The only hammers an unmodded player might look for would be Double Edge and Piercing Wave, though running ME can make looking for the right hammers less essential.

## for heat
Merciful End is needy and is not something to go for the higher one climbs into heats. Go this route at your own risk.
Flat Damage Soup is significantly more common, and comes along in two forms:
- the usual poseidon/athena dash -> FDS shenanigans tends to be a constant on the swords. Thus, [Retrash's unmodded WR (55)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPQOZFgDlx4>) and [AngeL1C's modded WR (56)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSja6ImOZBo>) both go this route. They both use a flat damage attack (zeus or dionysus) and interestingly both get a detrimental hammer during the run, clearing despite that (athenacall helped)!
- Athena attack (+ poms) + World Splitter is a valid idea as well, since the innate attack speed makes the World Splitter 2-button rotation less clunky than it would be without. Take Shadow Slash or Breaching Slash as second hammer if they show up. Running chop also means less detrimental hammers: one never wants to press special anyway so Dash Nova becomes no longer detrimental, and Flurry Slash is outright unavailable. Only Cursed Slash remains. Also, chopp locks out Cruel Thrust. This means one can take the second hammer without having to worry as much about bad second hammers ruining the run.
