# Aspect of the Week : :spaghetti: Beowulf Shield :diamonds:

TACTICAL NUKE INCOMING! The shield's Aspect of Beowulf AKA spaghetti-plate (affectionate) packs quite a punch! Enough to 1-shot any enemy given enough luck. Just don't forget about your hammer!

The most common strategy on Beowulf is to start the run with Poseidon's Flood Flare cast which needs a pom or two to start feeling good, then pick up any of Artemis' cores other than her dash as soon as possible to open Mirage Shot :green_square: . Hunt down Hyper Sprint -> Rush Delivery from Hermes as usual, anything else tends to feel weak. <:catokey:1014317452051632278>

No matter what flare you use, for Any Heat you always want to hit the 3/13 odds of Charged Shot.

For the full decision-making process, this [build guide](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B7qCbSaBgREflZ3Wm_5vXf95f8RLHwav-KbjUJifY0k/edit?tab=t.0>) by kirrby has got you covered. A more [general overview](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H7EOP28oyu6t8KrBEfnrN-dQc6H_ssvAyYz3C1O2JOI/edit?tab=t.0>) of this aspect by Papertronics can be found here.

As usual, here are the [unmodded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/m3l475dm>) by Drk, and the [modded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/y2je6x7z>) by Vorime.


## for heat
Aphrodite's Crush Flare is preferred here due to making enemies weaker and being generally strong on its own, though Flood Flare is still a decently effective option as well. You won't see Flood Flare at high-end runs though since it requires a duoboon to work.

Records-wise, Beo is one of the rare aspects with a tied heat-record for both unmodded and modded (60)!
