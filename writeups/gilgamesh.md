# Aspect of the Week : :feet: Gilgamesh Fists :up:

Paws up! This aspect is the epitome of "Survivability? What survivability?". It comes equipped with shorter dashes, but you get two more of them. It is perhaps the only aspect on which Ruthless Reflex is even a consideration for AnyHeat. It also has a maim effect on the special which allows for some fun meg summon tech ~~and express-trips back to the house of Hades if you're careless~~! Though, be careful to dashstrike with these claws, they tend to hit like a pool noodle before Merciful End. 😔

You'll either be looking for Poseidon's dash and any and all of the tier 2s it opens (as well as perhaps Sea Storm + Static Discharge from zeus. Or perhaps you'd be interested in a Lightning Rod? ... You'll figure something out), or the usual Merciful End stuff.

Hammer-wise, the only options to consider are Breaching Cross or Rending claws, though the latter is trickier to play. Your Hermes needs should be either extra dashes or Hyper Sprint -> Rush Delivery. There is also the decently cursed idea of accepting Swift Strike to make the aspect less clunky, but you would be passing up potentially a lot of damage by doing so.

Both the [unmodded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/ydlxpovz>) and the [modded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/m3kr5pgy>) by CherryDad use <:MercifulEnd:1051868903422300170>, but don't let that discourage you from trying poseidon dash start! Both have yielded results in the past.

## for heat
Merciful End can work, if you don't value your sanity. For those tired of Merciful End, maybe consider an ares dash like in the [unmodded WR (53)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUPWgs-27BQ>) by Retrash, or a Dionysus attack start as seen in the [modded WR (55)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DumyWYJ1-F8>) by Angel? Preferred hammers and hermes choices do not change to my knowledge.
