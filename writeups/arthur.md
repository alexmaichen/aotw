# Aspect of the Week 251: :crown: Arthur Sword :crossed_swords:
It is time to go in search of the holy grail, as the previous owner of the Chunk-Sword:tm: once did. This is the aspect with the slowest average animation in the game. Following that trend, it is also one of the slowest speedrunning-aspects overall, however it can still shine in the fronthalf.

Try to get a source of damage for regular rooms, say, zeus cast -> static discharge + lightning rod, or poseidon cast with various poseidon tier 2s. Poseidon dash is another classic to pick up as first boon, and shackle start is known to be effective as well. Shockingly for a melee-aspect however, Merciful End is considered a deprecated build-idea!

Compared to the other three swords, hammers on this aspect shockingly don't matter as much. Were you to want one, it would be Double Edge like usual, to give Arthur a way of dealing damage faster than like once every second.

For those requiring inspiration, the [unmodded WR by magnil](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/z5r1jwjy>) and [modded WR by bablo](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/zpplv08z>) are available to watch.

There is also an [Arthur guide](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vIWO9-pGrs6_Ez2CHZQr_ICs7ViEybxavvtVAUwKMCU/edit?tab=t.0>) by Nalei which goes in-depth into the aspect.


## for heat
Get an Aphrodite attack or Athena attack, a few poms, and focus everything on attacks and dashstrikes. Other valuable boons include Life Affirmation, Divine Dash, and any call that gives invulnerability to press in the event of panic or mistakes. Your goal is to stay in the Holy Ground's AoE so as to continue tanking hits more freely.

Nearly any hammer will work for this! Get something that affects the attack and that should be plenty. Preferred options are Double Edge (still), Shadow Slash and Cursed Slash.

For Arthur heat, the [modded WR by Cheesy (60)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTqpFXcw7gw>) and [unmodded WR by NephiOH (57)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOF3YfqCwBE>) are both hugely impressive, and both showcase the aforementioned build.

## Mini of the Week 251: :ghost: Tartarus-hunting :ArtemisBond:
As was mentioned above, Excalibur performs best in Tartarus and Asphodel. With the aspect of choice, how about we indulge in some kingly sports in honor of king Arthur and go hunt? Tag your best tartarus-splits (even for runs that die later) for this MotW, regardless of aspect!

As a frame of reference, the best sub-6 run Arthur tartarus is a 1:43.35 by bablo (probably due to the small run sample-size), and the best sub-6 run tartarus ever was a Beowulf 1:05:68 by Edward77.
