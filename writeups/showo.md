## Category of the Week : :four: SHOWO :shield:
Who's ready for sometimes two, usually three completely different build-paths on the same weapon? The one for Chaos and Zagshield was explained above, which can also be used on zeus though there are stronger and more unique options for this one: zeus² (zeus special, get as much zeus as possible) or ME (except it's buildable both ways around and does not need divine dash immediately). Zeus also is unique in the sense that it has two about equally viable starting-hammers. Everyone's favourite plate of pasta is also present, usually used at the end to close the run out thanks to the absolute immense damage flood flare + mirage shot provides.
The [unmodded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/zxwp66em>) by ocke as well as the [modded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/mewrxg9m>) by zyru are both available to watch for anyone curious.
