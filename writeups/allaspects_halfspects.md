## Category of the Week : :two: Half-/All-spects :four:
Ok, but what if one wanted to play every aspect, not just Chiron? That's what this category is for!
In All Aspects, your overall consistency on every part of RTA Anyheat matters. 24 consecutive runs, amounting to 6 to 8.5 hours of time-investment. Halfspects is the same, but one may leave out the half of aspects they may not want to play, for half the time-investment. Solid way to learn to build every aspect on-the-fly though!

The Allspects [unmodded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/me268xqm>) and the [modded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/mk14wwly>), as well as halfspects [unmodded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/zg6v7v0m>) and [modded](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/z0qe00om>) WRs (all by Ananke) are available to watch.
