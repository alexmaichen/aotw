## Category of the Week 251: :ZagreusSword: :Nemesis: SwOwO :Poseidon: :Arthur:
Four swords and probably about three strategies.
- Zagsword can run ME, hermes plume for RD, or splash dash.
- Nemesis is usually splash dash -> crit-scaling. ME obviously works too.
- Poseidon can run the regular sword strategies listed above, but can also build around a chunky cast.
- Arthur runs the same build idea detailed in the anyheat writeup above.

This [sword guide](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GvdbSS3DrM0LHzZWWmWHt15Z87LFNUf-xUmH1_BMLps/edit>) by trash_lapras is more complete than this short overview. It covers all four aspects.

Here are the [unmodded swowo WR by arcalena](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/z5p0jpnm>) and the [modded swowo WR by zyru](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/z58409gz>).

## Category of the Week : :crossed_swords: SwOWO :crossed_swords:
Four times the swords, four times the potentially unique builds!
All four of these stabby sticks have some differences in build-path. One may consider equipping Hermes' keepsake at some point during the run for zagsword, scaling part of the build off casts for Poseidon, scaling a bunch more off crits for nemesis, and building lightning rod / attack for arthur! Available options should be featured in the sword guide linked in the first part of the writeup.

Here are Arcalena's [unmodded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/z5p0jpnm>) and Zyruvias' [modded WR](<https://www.speedrun.com/hades/runs/z58409gz>) if you require inspiration.
